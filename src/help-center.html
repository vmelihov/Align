                            physically attend a class. There are benefits to both. An online class gives you the benefit
                            of
                            taking the class from anywhere, as long as you have a computer and internet connection.

                            does give you the flexibility; physical attendance gives you the benefit of interacting with

                            Accreditation is the process by which a schoolʼs curriculum is analyzed and approved by the
                            accreditation body. The goal of accreditation is to ensure that education provided by
                            institutions
                            of higher education meets acceptable levels of quality. There is an online database of

                            There are a few factors to consider when thinking about school costs: tuition, housing,
                            commute,
                            books, extracurricular activities, etc. Please inquire with the school advisor you will be

                            with.

                            Once you are connected with a school advisor, there’s a few important tasks to consider to
                            proceed.
                            Often times there’s an admission test, an overview of previous GPA, and SAT scores. Expect
                            to also
                            have an in-person interview with the schoolʼs admission team, that may also request a
                            written essay
                            to be submitted to the school. It helps admissions officers understand who you are, what
                            makes you
                            unique and why this school and program are important to you.

                            College applications and enrollment dates vary for every college. For some, it is open all
                            year
                            round while for others it depends on the class size, duration of courses/programs offered,
                            state
                            licensing requirements, etc. Itʼs best to contact the college you are considering as soon as
                            you can
                            and speak with their admissions department.
